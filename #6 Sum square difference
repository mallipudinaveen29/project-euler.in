'''The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is,1**2+2**2.......+10**2=385;

The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is(1+2+3+......10)**2=3025,

Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers and the square of the sum is .

Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first one hundred natural numbers and the square of the sum.'''
